## Vinicius Caracho
<h1>About me</h1>

Hello! My name is Vinicius, and I am a 20-year-old Software Engineering student. Since starting college, I've had to work to support myself throughout my studies. My journey began as a Technical Support professional at Codengage, where I later transitioned to a Test Analyst role while still maintaining my initial responsibilities.

Although this dual role left me with little time for personal projects, it provided me with valuable experience in development. I gained proficiency in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript frameworks like Turbo, among others.

Furthermore, I have been advancing my skills in Data Engineering by working on ETL processes and applying DevOps culture concepts to my personal projects.
